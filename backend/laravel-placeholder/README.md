# Laravel placeholder (backend/laravel-placeholder)

This folder contains migration and model **stubs** and instructions to create the real Laravel backend.

To create a real Laravel app locally:

1. Install PHP 8.1+, Composer and a database (MySQL/Postgres/SQLite).
2. Run: `composer create-project laravel/laravel backend/laravel-real` (or run inside this folder and move stubs)
3. Add migrations/controllers shown in this placeholder to the Laravel app and run `php artisan migrate --seed`.

I can fully implement the Laravel backend (models, controllers, migrations, tests, PHI OCR integration) next — tell me to proceed when you're ready.
